Cipher text-policy Attribute-based encryption

In several distributed systems a user should only be able to access data if a user possess a certain set of credentials or attributes. Currently, the only method for enforcing such policies is to employ a trusted server to store the data and mediate access control. However, if any server storing the data is compromised, then the confidentiality of the data will be compromised. 

In this project we present a system for realizing complex access control on encrypted data that we call ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption. 

By using our techniques encrypted data can be kept confidential even if the storage server is untrusted; moreover, our methods are secure against collusion attacks.
